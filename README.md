# Covid19-Tracker-Cambodia

An IOS application which getting the data from a trustable website (API) in order to show the Covid19 cases overview in Cambodia. 

It's basically my self-learning project, most parts are conducting using the JSON Decoder in swift. I used StoryBoard in this project to layout stuffs that 
will appear on the screen, as well as Adobe Xd, and Illustrator for the UIDesign.
