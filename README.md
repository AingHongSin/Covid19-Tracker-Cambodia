##Tasks 
//Specify the purpose behind the app. 

##Things to working on 
- Push notification every time the API Updated. 
- Alert the user when the internet is disconnected. 

##Added Opinion
It's basically my self-learning project, most parts are conducting using the JSON Decoder in swift. I used StoryBoard in this project to layout stuffs that 
will appear on the screen, as well as Adobe Xd, and Illustrator for the UIDesign.
