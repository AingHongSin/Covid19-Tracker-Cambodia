- Providing accurate statistic. 
- Fast, easy, and convenient for user to check the data. 

### Updated 

- Automatically add the API Fetching data to Userdefault. 

### Error Alert 

`The Api's dead sometimes, I barely find a better API Provider that provides better services than the one that I'm currently using. 
However, the updating data on the API could be processed 5-10 hours later than Cambodian time.`

`It's hard to track up since the goverment does not providing any API for the developers.` 

### Things to be working on 

- Push notification every time the API Updated. 
- Alert the user when the internet is disconnected. 
- Add the graph of Corona Virus Cases in the SecondScreen. (From the Cambodian Government Embed Link) 
- Switching between Cambodia, and Global data. 

### Added Opinion

*It's basically my self-learning project, most parts are conducting using the JSON Decoder in swift. I used StoryBoard in this project to layout stuffs that 
will appear on the screen, as well as Adobe Xd, and Illustrator for some pieces to decorate the UI.*
